## Unreleased

* `HarborSignals.raise` with no harbor above the context shows the signal in the nearest `Overlay`, clear of `MediaQuery.padding` and `viewInsets`, instead of asserting in debug and showing nothing in release. With no overlay either, it reports a `FlutterError`.
* A signal's timers are cancelled when it is lowered or its harbor leaves with nowhere to move it, so a widget test that removes the tree with a signal up no longer fails with a pending timer.

## 0.1.0

The first harbor.

* `Harbor`, `HarborSea`: frames whose edges docks are built against, laid out in one pass (docks, then the body, then the buoys).
* `HarborDock.pier` / `.quay`: measured docks that content sails under or starts beyond; wakes (`HarborWake.fade`, `.hairline`), tide stances (float, pilings, dry dock), states (open, dark, withdrawn) with extent policies, resting extents, minimums.
* `HarborCoast`: the platform's insets, fixed coasts, `HarborCoast.none`, and TV title-safe.
* `HarborTide`, `HarborDryDock`: the keyboard's height after it is consumed, its phase and its high-water mark.
* Content: `HarborMoored`, `HarborMooringLine`, `HarborFairway` (vertical and horizontal, reveals widened by what covers the edge), `HarborFairwaySliver`, `HarborSliverDock`, `HarborOpenWater`, `HarborCastOff`, and the `HarborWaters` breakdown.
* `HarborMakeWay`, `HarborPontoon`, `HarborController`: claims on an edge and docks moored from deep in the tree.
* `HarborBuoy` (aligned, anchored, modal), `HarborAnchor`, `HarborSignals`.
* `showHarborSheet`, `HarborSheet` (content-sized and draggable), breakwaters, `showHarborDialog`.
* `HarborLighthouse`, `HarborBeacon`, `HarborLighthouseRegion`: reveal, keep in sight, lift, and coverage.
* `HarborScaleModel`: a reference screen scaled to fit, with insets re-based.
* `HarborChart`, `HarborChartOverlay`, and the `ext.harbor.chart` VM-service extension.
* `package:harbor/testing.dart`: `pumpSeaTrial`, `HarborTrialDevice` presets and `isInClearWater`.
